# reinforcementlearning

In this project, the basic building-blocks of Reinforcement Learning are implemented for a discrete grid-world
model. Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, SARSA and Q-Learning are considered. The convergence to an optimal
policy and value functions is examined for all 4 algorithms.
